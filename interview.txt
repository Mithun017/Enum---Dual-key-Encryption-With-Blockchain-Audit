INTERVIEW PREPARATION GUIDE
Project: Dual-Key Encryption with Blockchain Audit & Post-Quantum Security
================================================================================

1. THE "ELEVATOR PITCH" (How to explain the project in 30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I built an ultra-secure data vault designed to eliminate single points of failure. 
It uses a 'Dual-Key' architecture, meaning data can only be decrypted if you have 
BOTH the server's key and the user's password. To ensure accountability, every single 
access attempt is permanently recorded on an immutable Blockchain Ledger. 
I also future-proofed it against next-generation threats by integrating 'Kyber', 
a Post-Quantum Cryptographic algorithm."


2. CORE PROBLEM SOLVED (Why did you build this?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most security systems have two major flaws:
1. Single Point of Failure: If a hacker steals the database key (or an admin goes rogue), they can decrypt everything.
2. Lack of Accountability: Admins can often view sensitive data and then delete the logs to cover their tracks.
3. Future Threats: Standard encryption (like RSA) will be easily broken by future Quantum Computers.

My solution fixes all three:
- Dual-Key = No single person/key can decrypt data.
- Blockchain = Logs cannot be deleted or tampered with.
- Kyber = Safe against Quantum Computers.


3. HOW THE SECURITY WORKS (The "Dual-Key" Logic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Think of a bank safety deposit box that requires TWO keys to open:
- Key A (System Key): Stored securely in the server's database.
- Key B (User Key): A password known ONLY to the user (never stored).

The Algorithm Flow:
1. When encrypting, we combine Key A + Key B to create a temporary "Master Key".
2. This Master Key encrypts the data using AES-256 (military-grade standard).
3. The Master Key is immediately destroyed from memory.
4. Result: The server has the encrypted data and Key A, but it CANNOT decrypt it without the user's Key B.


4. WHAT IS KYBER? (Post-Quantum Cryptography)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What is Kyber?
A: Kyber is a "Key Encapsulation Mechanism" (KEM) selected by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) as the new standard for post-quantum security.

Q: Why use it?
A: Traditional encryption (RSA/ECC) relies on math problems that Quantum Computers can solve instantly. Kyber relies on "Lattice-based cryptography," which is incredibly hard even for Quantum Computers to solve.

Q: How is it used here?
A: I use Kyber to securely "wrap" or encapsulate the System Key. This ensures that even if a hacker records all our encrypted traffic today and buys a Quantum Computer 10 years from now, they still can't crack the key exchange.


5. HOW THE BLOCKCHAIN WORKS (The Audit Trail)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I implemented a local blockchain ledger to track every event (Encryption, Decryption, Failure).

Structure of a Block:
- Index: Block #1, #2, #3...
- Timestamp: Exact time of event.
- Event Type: e.g., "FILE_DECRYPTION".
- User ID: Who did it?
- Previous Hash: The digital fingerprint of the block before it.
- Current Hash: The fingerprint of this block + Previous Hash.

Why it's secure:
If a rogue admin tries to delete Block #5, the "Previous Hash" in Block #6 won't match anymore. The chain breaks, and the system instantly detects the tampering. This guarantees an "Immutable Audit Trail."


6. TECHNICAL STACK (How I built it)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Frontend: React.js + Vite (Fast, modern UI).
- Backend: Python FastAPI (High performance, great for async tasks).
- Database: MySQL (Reliable structured storage).
- Cryptography: 
    - `pycryptodome` for AES-256.
    - `pqc` (Post-Quantum Crypto) libraries for Kyber.
- Blockchain: Custom Python implementation using SHA-256 hashing.


7. REAL-WORLD USE CASES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Healthcare: Storing patient records. Doctors need access, but every view must be logged to comply with privacy laws (HIPAA).
2. Defense/Government: Storing Top Secret documents where "Two-Man Rule" (Dual Key) is mandatory.
3. Finance: Protecting high-value transaction logs from insider threats (rogue employees).
4. Legal Evidence: Storing digital evidence where you must prove in court that the file hasn't been altered (Chain of Custody).


8. KEY CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenge: Integrating Kyber (it's new and complex).
Solution: I created a wrapper class (`kyber_utils.py`) to handle the complex encapsulation/decapsulation logic, exposing simple `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods to the rest of the app.

Challenge: Making the Blockchain persistent.
Solution: Initially, it was in-memory. I migrated it to MySQL so the ledger survives server restarts, while maintaining the cryptographic linking logic in Python.

Challenge: Handling large files.
Solution: I used Python's `UploadFile` stream processing to handle file uploads efficiently without crashing the server memory.


9. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adding Google Authenticator for extra login security.
- Decentralization: Replicating the blockchain across multiple servers so if one burns down, the logs survive.
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM): Storing the System Key on a physical USB stick instead of the database for maximum security.
